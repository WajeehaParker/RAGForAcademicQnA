each Key Question.', '•  Each Focus Point is tackled through a Focus Task.', 'If you tackle all the\\nFocus Points, you will be in a strong position to form your own arguments\\nand views in relation to the Key Question.', 'It will help you to learn the content\\nThis book  covers the Option B 20th century route through the Core Content\\nplus three Depth Studies.', 'You will need good k nowledge of the main events\\nand the detail.', 'This book  will help you acquire both.', 'The author text explains all the key content clearly.', 'But it does not just drone\\non about one thing after another.', 'It helps you understand and investigate\\nissues and establish links and relationships between topics.', 'SOURCE 1\\nAn American cartoon commenting on Stalin’s\\ntake-over of eastern Europe.', 'The bear\\nrepresents the USSR.', 'It’s full of brilliant sources.', 'History is at its best when you can see\\nwhat real people said, did, wrote, sang, watched on film, laughed\\nabout, cried over and got upset about.', 'Sources can really help you\\nto understand the story better and remember it because they help\\nyou to see the big concepts and ideas in terms of what they meant\\nto individuals at the time.', 'Factfile\\nThe League of Nations\\n•  The League’s home was in Geneva in Switzerland.', 'The Factfiles (key events) and Profiles (key people) are packed\\nwith hard facts and examples to use in your own work to support\\nyour arguments.', 'Think!', 'Think of a suitable headline for each of the six ‘episodes’ in the\\ncollapse of the USSR.', 'Many of the Focus Tasks deal with quite big issues that you will\\nfind easier if you have thought things through beforehand.', 'So the\\nThink!', 'feature is designed to prepare you for the Focus Tasks.', 'Sometimes they are literally steps en route to a Focus Task, as in\\nChapter 4; at other times they simply ask you to think about an\\nissue that is particularly important for understanding the period\\nbetter.', 'Activities serve a similar purpose – get you thinking about\\nwhat you are reading – but they usually invite a more creative\\nresponse.', 'Revision Tip\\nMake sure you can remember at least two examples of agreement\\nat Yalta and the one (main!)', 'disagreement.', 'There are Revision Tips.', 'If the content seems overwhelming to\\nyou and you just don’t know where to

the end of every chapter or\\nKey Question.', 'This condenses all the content into a few points,\\nwhich should help you to get your bearings in even the most\\ncomplicated content.', 'It will help you to apply what you learn\\nThe next big aim of this book  is to help you to work with the content and\\nthink about it so that you are ready to apply what you learn.', 'This is not an\\neasy

to your argument.', 'FOCUS TASK 8.10\\nHow did the Bolsheviks consolidate their rule?', '1  Draw a timeline from 1917 to 1924, and mark on it the events of\\nthat period mentioned in the text.', '2  Mark on the timeline:\\n    a)  one moment at which you think Bolshevik rule was most\\nthreatened\\n    b)  one moment at which you think it was most secure.', '3  Write an explanation of how the

the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\\n    •  the victory in the Civil War\\n    •  the promise of a new society\\nThe main way we help you with this is through the Focus Tasks.', 'The title is a Focus Point or Key Question from the Cambridge\\nIGCSE and O-Level syllabus.', 'Every Focus Point has its own Focus\\nTask.', 'Often we ask you to create a comparative or a summary chart or\\ntimeline, as in this example.', 'The completed chart will also be\\nperfect for revision purposes.', 'They help you to apply your knowledge.', 'One of the most\\nimportant skills in history is the ability to select, organise and\\ndeploy (use) knowledge to answer a particular question.', 'The structure of the task helps you to focus on what is important\\nand ignore what is not.', 'There are bullet points or charts to help you\\nto organise your thinking.', 'And remember, to help you further, most Focus Tasks have a linked\\nRevision Tip that gives you a more basic target – just a couple of\\nkey points that you will be able to apply in your answers.', 'It helps you prepare for your examination\\nIf you read all the text and tackled all the Focus Tasks in this book  we are\\nsure you would also find you were well prepared for the challenges of your\\nexam, but you will probably also want something more exam-focused – y ou\\nwill want to see the kind of questions you will face in an exam and how you\\nmight go about answering them.', 'So:\\nExam Focus\\nExam Focus starts on page 172 (for the Core Content) and page\\n346 (for the Depth Studies).', 'These pages take you step by step\\nthrough the exam requirements and show you the kinds of\\nquestions you might be asked, although these are not past paper\\nquestions.', 'We also analyse and comment on some sample\\nanswers.', 'These are not answers by past candidates.', 'We have\\nwritten them to help you to see what a good answer might look\\nlike.', 'EXAM-STYLE QUESTIONS\\n1  (a)  What were the Five-Year Plans?', '(4)\\nExam-Style Questions.', 'At the end of every chapter we have\\nwritten some exam-style questions for you to practise.', 'These are\\nnot from past papers.', 'And in the Exam Focus sections there are\\nplenty more examples of structured essays and questions on\\nprescribed topics with sources and information.', 'Source Analysis\\nExplain how and why Sources 11 and 12 differ in their interpretation\\nof the Soviet intervention.', 'Source Analysis.', 'Sources are an integral part of history.', 'Historians\\nuse them to write history.', 'We have used them to add colour and\\nhuman detail to the stories of Modern World History.', 'In Cambridge\\nIGCSE and O-Level History you will also use sources to examine an\\nissue, when you will need to evaluate sources.', 'So dotted throughout\\nthis book are

period of  European history.', 'After\\nthe trauma of the First World War, citizens of European countries were\\nhoping for peace, prosperity and calm.', 'Instead they got revolutions,\\neconomic depression, international disputes, dictatorships, and in the end a\\nSecond World War.', 'How did this happen?', '•  In Chapter 1 you will examine the peace treaties at the end of the First\\nWorld War and consider whether they were fair.', 'Some would say that the\\npeace treaties created problems for the future; others that they were the\\nfairest they could have been given the very difficult situation after the First\\nWorld War.', '•  The League of Nations was set up in 1920 t o prevent war between\\ncountries.', 'In Chapter 2 you will evaluate its successes (it did have many)\\nand its failures (which tend to be remembered rather more than the\\nsuccesses) and reach your own view on how we should remember the\\nLeague – as a success or a failure or something between.', '•  Finally in Chapter 3 you will examine the events of the 1930s  which\\nfinally tipped Europe back into war.', 'It is common to blame Hitler and his\\nforeign policy for this slide to war but this chapter will help you to reach a\\nbalanced view that sees what other factors played a part.', 'The events in these chapters overlap in time.', 'The timeline below gives you\\nan overview of the main events you will be studying.', 'It would be helpful if\\nyou made your own copy and added your own notes to it as you study.', '1 Were the peace treaties of 1919–\\n23 fair?', 'FOCUS POINTS\\n•  What were the motives and aims of the Big Three at Versailles?', '•  Why did all the victors not get everything they wanted?', '•  What was the impact of the peace treaty on Germany up to\\n1923?', '•  Could the treaties be justified at the time?', 'This British cartoon was published in 1919 shortly after the\\nterms of the Treaty of Versailles had been announced.', 'A\\nGerman man is holding the treaty terms which say how much\\nGermany has to pay for the damage caused by the war.', '1  Does he think the Treaty is fair?', 'Why or why not?', '2  Does the cartoonist think the Treaty is fair?', 'Why or why not?', '3  What is the message of this cartoon?', 'However long or violent a war is, eventually the oppos ing sides must make\\npeace.', 'But because war is destructive and leaves a bitter legacy, the\\npeacemaking after a long conflict can be the hardest job of  all.', 'The people who had that role in 1919 h ad a particularly hard task.', 'The First\\nWorld War involved more countries, using more pow erful weapons, causing\\ngreater casualties and physical destruction, than any war before it.', 'The war\\nhad bankrupted some countries.', 'It led to revolutions in others.', 'There was\\nbitterness and resentment.', 'In this post-war atmosphere almost everyone agreed that part of the job of  the\\npeacemakers was to avoid another war like it – bu t no one agreed how to do\\nthat.', 'Any treaty is a balancing act.', 'The peacemakers have to keep the victors\\nhappy but ensure that the defeated country accepts the terms of the peace.', 'Was it really possible to produce a treaty which all sides would have seen as\\nfair?', 'That’s the key question you will have to think about in this chapter.', 'You are going to investigate what happened when these peacemakers got\\ntogether to draw up the peace treaties.', 'You will focus on:\\n•  what the peacemakers were hoping to achieve\\n•  how they worked\\n•  what they decided\\n•  why they decided it.', 'Then you will reach conclusions about the key question – how ‘fair’ were the\\ntreaties they came up with, which means thinking about:\\n•  whether people at the time thought the treaties were fair, and why or why\\nnot\\n•  whether historians (with the benefit of hindsight) think they were fair.', 'And remember…\\nthe peace process was not just about Germany.', 'Between 1919 a nd 1923 t he\\npeacemakers drew up five treaties (one for each of the defeated pow ers)\\nalthough in this chapter you are going to focus most on the Treaty which dealt\\nwith Germany: the Treaty of Versailles.', 'Aims of the Big Three: Wilson’s\\nviewpoint\\nHigh hopes for peace\\nLooking back it may seem that the peacemakers in 1919 h ad an impossible\\njob.', 'But that is not how people saw it at the time.', 'There was great optimism.', 'One of the main reasons for these high hopes was the American President\\nWoodrow Wilson.', 'In 1918 W ilson made a speech outlining Fourteen Points (see Factfile),\\nguidelines for a just and lasting peace treaty to end conflict.', 'When he arrived in Europe for the Paris Peace Conference, Wilson was seen\\nalmost as a saintly figure.', 'Newspaper reports described wounded soldiers in\\nItaly trying to kiss the hem of his cloak and in France peasant families\\nkneeling to pray as his train passed by.', 'Profile\\nWoodrow Wilson\\n(President of the USA)\\nBackground\\n•  Born 1856.', '•  Became a university professor.', '•  First entered politics in 1910.', '•  Became President in 1912 and was re-elected in 1916.', '•  From 1914 to 1917 he concentrated on keeping the USA out of\\nthe war.', '•  Once the USA had joined the war in 1917, he drew up the\\nFourteen Points as the basis for ending the war fairly, so that\\nfuture wars could be avoided.', 'Character\\n•  An idealist and a reformer.', '•  As President, he had campaigned against corruption in politics\\nand business.', 'However, he had a poor record with regard to the\\nrights of African Americans.', '•  He was obstinate.', 'Once he made his mind up on an issue he was\\nalmost impossible to shift.', 'Wilson’s ideas\\nHow did Wilson think the peacemakers could build a better and more\\npeaceful world?', '•  Don’t be too harsh on Germany.', 'Wilson did believe Germany should be\\npunished.', 'But he also believed that if Germany was treated harshly, some\\nday it would recover and want revenge.', 'He was also concerned that\\nextremist groups, especially communists, might exploit resentment among\\nthe Germans and communists might even seize pow er in Germany as they\\nhad in Russia in 1917.', '•  Strengthen democracy in defeated countries.', 'For Wilson democracy\\nwas a key to peace in Europe.', 'If leaders in defeated nations had to listen to\\nthe views of their people and win their votes those people would not let\\ntheir leaders cause another war.', '•  Give self-determination to small countries that had once been part of\\nthe European empires.', 'He wanted the different peoples of eastern Europe\\n(for example, Poles, Czechs and Slovaks) to rule themselves rather than be\\npart of Austria–Hungary’s empire.', '•  International co-operation.', 'Wilson also believed that nations should co-\\noperate to achieve world peace.', 'This would be achieved through a\\n‘League of Nations’, Wilson’s most important of the Fourteen Points.', 'You can see from these principles that Wilson was an idealist.', 'However, he\\nwas not a politician who could be pushed around.', 'For example, he refused to\\ncancel the debts owed to the USA by Britain and its Allies so that he could\\nput pressure on them to accept his ideas.', 'FOCUS TASK 1.1\\nWhat were the motives and aims of the Big Three at\\nVersailles?', 'Using the information and sources on

many were doubtful about Wilson’s ideas for achieving it.', 'For\\nexample, ‘self-determination’: it would be very difficult to give the peoples\\nof eastern Europe the oppor tunity to rule themselves because they were\\nscattered across many countries.', 'Some people were bound to end up being\\nruled by people from another group with different customs and a different\\nlanguage.', 'Some historians have pointed out that while Wilson talked a great\\ndeal about eastern and central Europe, he did not actually know very much\\nabout the area.', 'There were other concerns as well.', 'So let’s look at the aims and views of the\\nother leaders at the Paris Peace Conference: David Lloyd George (from\\nBritain) and Georges Clemenceau (from France).', 'Profile\\nDavid Lloyd

until 1922.', 'Character\\nA realist.', 'As an experienced politician, he knew there would have to\\nbe compromise.', 'Thus he occupied the middle ground between the\\nviews of Wilson and Clemenceau.', 'Did Lloyd George agree with Wilson?', 'In public Lloyd George praised Wilson and his ideas.', 'However, in private he\\nwas less positive.', 'He complained to one of his officials that Wilson came to\\nParis like a missionary to rescue the European savages with his little\\nsermons and lectures.', 'He agreed with Wilson on many issues, particularly that Germany should be\\npunished but not too harshly.', 'He did not want Germany to seek revenge in the\\nfuture and pos sibly start another war.', 'Like Wilson he was deeply concerned that a harsh treaty might lead to a\\ncommunist revolution like the one in Russia in 1917.', 'He also wanted Britain\\nand Germany to begin trading with each other again.', 'Before the war,\\nGermany had been Britain’s second largest trading partner.', 'British people\\nmight not like it, but the fact was that trade with Germany meant jobs in\\nBritain.', 'However, unlike Wilson, Lloyd George had the needs of the British empire in\\nmind.', 'He wanted Germany to lose its navy and its colonies because they\\nthreatened the British empire.', 'SOURCE 2\\nWe want a peace which will be just, but not vindictive.', 'We want a\\nstern peace because the occasion demands it, but the severity\\nmust be designed, not for vengeance, but for justice.', 'Above all, we\\nwant to protect the future against a repetition of the

Analysis\\n1  In what ways are Sources 2 and 3 different?', '2  Are there any ways in which they are similar?', 'Pressures on Lloyd George\\nLloyd George faced huge public pressures at home for a harsh treaty (see\\nSource 2).', 'People in Britain were not sympathetic to Germany in any way.', 'They had suffered ove r 1 million casualties in the fighting, as well as food\\nshortages and other hardships at home.', 'They had been fed anti-German\\npropaganda for four years.', 'They had also seen how Germany had treated\\nRussia in 1918 w hen Russia surrendered.', 'Under the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk\\nGermany had stripped Russia of 25 pe r cent of its popu lation and huge areas\\nof Russia’s best agricultural land.', 'Lloyd George had just won the 1918 e lection in Britain by promising to\\n‘make Germany pay’, even though he realised the dangers of this course of\\naction.', 'So Lloyd George had to balance these pressures at home with his\\ndesire not to leave Germany wanting revenge.', 'Profile\\nGeorges Clemenceau\\n(Prime Minister of France)\\nBackground\\n•  Born 1841 (he was aged 77 when the Paris Conference began).', '•  First entered French politics in 1871.', '•  Was Prime Minister of France from 1906 to 1909.', '•  From 1914 to 1917 he was very critical of the French war\\nleaders.', 'In November 1917 he was elected to lead France\\nthrough the last year of the war.', 'Character\\nA hard, tough politician with a reputation for being uncompromising.', 'He had seen his country invaded twice by the Germans, in 1870\\nand in 1914.', 'He was determined not to allow such devastation ever\\nagain.', 'Did Clemenceau agree with Wilson?', 'In public, Clemenceau of course agreed with Wilson’s aim for a fair and\\nlasting peace.', 'However, he found Wilson very hard to work with.', 'While he\\ndid not publicly criticise the Fourteen Points, Clemenceau once pointed out\\nthat even God had only needed Ten Commandments!', 'The major disagreement was over Germany.', 'Clemenceau and other French\\nleaders saw the Treaty as an oppor tunity to cripple Germany so that it could\\nnot attack France again.', 'Pressures on Clemenceau\\nFrance had suffered enormous damage to its land, industry, people – and self-\\nconfidence.', 'Over two-thirds of the men who had served in the French army\\nhad been killed or wounded.', 'The war affected almost an entire generation.', 'By comparison, Germany seemed to many French people as pow erful and\\nthreatening as ever.', 'German land and industry had not been as badly damaged\\nas France’s.', 'France’s popu lation (around 40 m illion) was in decline\\ncompared to Germany’s (around 75 m illion).', 'The French people wanted a treaty that would punish Germany and weaken it\\nas much as possible.', 'The French President (Poincaré) even wanted Germany\\nbroken up into a collection of smaller states, but Clemenceau knew that the\\nBritish and Americans would not agree to this.', 'Clemenceau was a realist and knew he would probably be forced to\\ncompromise on some issues.', 'However, he had to show he was aware of\\npublic opinion in France.', 'Think!', '1  One of the ideas put forward at the Paris Conference was that\\nGermany should lose some of its key industrial areas.', 'How\\nwould you expect Lloyd George to react to a proposal like this?', 'You

generous attitude to Germany.', 'They disagreed ove r what to\\ndo about Germany’s Rhineland and coalfields in the Saar.', 'In the end,\\nWilson had to give way on these issues.', 'In return,

treaties, not the Treaty of Versailles.', '•  Clemenceau also clashed with Lloyd George, particularly over Lloyd\\nGeorge’s desire not to treat Germany too harshly.', 'For example,\\nClemenceau said that ‘if the British are so anxious to appease Germany\\nthey should look overseas and make colonial, naval or commercial\\nconcessions’.', 'Clemenceau felt that the British were quite happy to treat\\nGermany fairly in Europe, where France rather than Britain was most\\nunder threat.', 'However, they were less happy to allow Germany to keep its\\nnavy and colonies, which would be more of a threat to Britain.', '•  Wilson and Lloyd George did not always agree either.', 'Lloyd George\\nwas particularly unhappy with point 2 of the Fourteen Points, allowing all\\nnations access to the seas.', 'Similarly, Wilson’s views on people ruling\\nthemselves were threatening to the British government, for the British\\nempire ruled millions of people all across the world from London.', 'ACTIVITY\\nWho said what about whom?', 'Here are some statements that were made by the Big Three at the\\nParis Peace Conference.', 'Your task is to decide which leader made\\nthe statement and also

been ruling the waves for too long to accept\\nthe need for freedom of the seas.’\\nc)  ^He wants to wreck a country which in a few years could be a\\nvaluable trading partner and a source of vital jobs.’\\nd)  ‘Freedom of the seas is all very well but who or what will\\nprotect my country’s ships and trade?’\\ne)  ‘What does he know about colonies and how they should be\\nruled?', 'He probably doesn’t know where most of them are!’\\nf)  ‘How can I work with a man who thinks he is the first leader in\\n2000 years who knows anything about peace?’\\ng)  ‘If he is so anxious to make concessions to the Germans then\\nthey should look overseas and make naval or colonial\\nconcessions.’\\nh)  ‘He is stuck in the past.', 'If he gets his way Germany will be left\\nbitter and vengeful and there

or Alsace–Lorraine.’\\nThe terms of the Treaty of Versailles\\nNone of the Big Three was happy with the eventual terms of the Treaty.', 'After\\nmonths of negotiation, each of them had to compromise on some of their\\naims, otherwise there would never have been a treaty.', 'The main terms can be divided into five areas.', '1 War guiltThis clause was simple but was seen by the Germans\\nas extremely harsh.', 'Germany had to accept the blame\\nfor starting the war.', '2\\nReparationsThe major powers agreed, without consulting\\nGermany, that Germany had to pay reparations to the\\nAllies

Critical?', 'Versailles and the other treaties created a situation in\\nEurope which made war inevitable.', 'It was only a matter of time\\nbefore Germany tried to seek revenge, overturn the Treaty

of the time\\nbut they did not create them.', 'Politicians in the 1930s could\\nhave defended the treaties or changed them.', 'It was political\\nchoices in the 1930s which caused war not the treaties.', 'Factor 2: The failure of the League of Nations\\n•  Critical?', 'The League of Nations’ job was to make sure that\\ndisputes were sorted out legally.', 'In the 1920s it created a\\nspirit of co-operation.', 'But, in Manchuria 1931 and Abyssinia\\n1935–36 the League completely failed to stand up to\\naggression by Japan and Italy.', 'This encouraged Hitler’s\\naggression from 1936

CO-OPERATION\\nwhich had built up in the 1920s, and set countries against each\\nother.', 'Without the Depression leading to these problems there\\ncould not have been a war.', '•  Important?', 'The

the other factors – it did not cause\\nthe war in itself.', 'Even with the Depression Hitler could have\\nbeen stopped if Britain and France had had the will to resist\\nhim.', 'The Depression did not make war inevitable.', 'Factor 4: The policy of Appeasement\\n•  Critical?', 'Appeasement was critical because it made Hitler\\nthink he could get away with anything.', 'Britain and France could\\nhave stopped Hitler in 1936 when he marched troops into the\\nRhineland but their nerve failed.', 'From this point on Hitler felt he\\ncould not lose and took gamble after gamble.', 'As a result of\\nAppeasement he did not even believe Britain would fight him\\nwhen he invaded Poland in 1939.', '•  Important?', 'The policy of Appeasement only came about\\nbecause, without the USA, the League of Nations, and its\\nleading members Britain and France, were not strong enough\\nto keep peace.', 'The Depression so weakened Britain and\\nFrance that they did not have the money to oppose Hitler.', 'The\\npolicy of Appeasement would not have been followed without\\nthese other factors.', 'Factor 5: The Nazi–Soviet Pact\\n•  Critical?', 'Although Hitler thought that Britain and France would\\nnot fight him he was not sure about the Soviet Union.', 'So the\\nSoviet Union was the only country that stood in the way of his\\nplans.', 'Without the Nazi–Soviet Pact, Hitler would not have\\ntaken the gamble to invade Poland and war would never have\\nbegun.', '•  Important?', 'The Pact allowed Hitler to invade Poland, but war\\nwas already inevitable before that – due to Hitler’s actions and\\nhis hatred of communism.', 'Hitler had made clear his plans to\\ntake land from the USSR.', 'Plus it was the policy of\\nAppeasement that drove Stalin to sign the Pact because he\\nthought he could not rely on the support of Britain or France to\\noppose Hitler.', 'Factor 6: Hitler’s actions\\n•  Critical?', 'There could have been no war without Hitler.', 'It was\\nHitler’s vision of Lebensraum, his hatred of communism and his\\ndetermination to reverse the Versailles settlement which led to\\nwar.', 'He consciously built up Germany’s army and weapons\\nwith the intention of taking it to war.', 'At each stage of the road\\nto war from 1936 to 1939 it was Hitler’s beliefs, actions or\\ndecisions that caused the problem.', '•  Important?', 'Hitler was the gambler.', 'He only did what he could\\nget away with.', 'So without the weakness of the League of\\nNations, or the reluctance of Britain, France or the Soviet Union\\nto stand up to him; without the flawed treaties; without the\\neconomic problems of the 1930s, Hitler would not have got\\nanywhere.', 'He would have been forced to follow a more\\npeaceful foreign policy and there would have been no war.', 'Stage 2: Investigate connections between factors\\nFrom Stage 1 it should be clear to you that these factors are\\nconnected to each other.', 'Let’s investigate these connections.', 'a)

using,\\nevaluating and comparing them towards a final question that gets you using\\nall the sources to answer the big question.', '•  The skill you need to answer source-based questions is to think like a\\nhistorian.', 'This means doing more than extracting basic information from a\\nsource.', 'It means considering the following:\\n    –  Purpose: why the source was produced.', '–  Audience: the audience for the source.', '–  Methods: the methods used in the source to convince its audience.', '–  Attitudes: what the source reveals about the person/people who made\\nit, for example their attitudes, values, concerns.', 'The makers may be\\nangry, afraid, unhappy, outraged … a nd much more.', '–  Tone: sources may deny, criticise, mock, praise, accuse, threaten or\\nwarn, and this will allow you to make inferences about the author of\\nthe source.', '•  As well as the content of the sources, you will also need to use your\\nbackground knowledge to evaluate the sources (e.g.', 'your knowledge of\\nevents might confirm what is being said in a source, or your knowledge of\\na particular group might help you to evaluate a source produced by that\\ngroup).', 'Advice\\n•  Read through all the sources before you start writing anything.', '•  Read through all the questions as well.', 'Note the marks for each so you\\nknow how much time to spend.', '•  Always support your answers with details from the sources.', 'For written\\nsources use actual words or phrases from the source to support your\\nanswer.', 'For visual sources describe relevant features from the source and\\nexplain how they support your answer.', '•  Use your background knowledge whenever it’s helpful, but don’t include\\nbackground knowledge just for its own sake if it’s got nothing to do w ith\\nthe source or the question.', '•  When you use your own knowledge avoid saying ‘my knowledge tells\\nme…’.', 'Just state what you know.', '•  Avoid speculation – so avoid using words like ‘might’ and ‘could’ (such\\nas ‘The author might be a supporter so he could be biased…’).', '•  Avoid phrases such as ‘we don’t know what else…’ or ‘she could have\\nforgotten…’.', 'This type of phrase could apply to any

in\\nVietnam…’).', 'Question types\\n•  This page gives examples of question types.', 'You could encounter any type\\nof question about any type of source so this is not comprehensive!', 'These\\nare only a small selection of possible question types.', '•  It is also important to remember that your answers to the different types of\\nquestion will vary depending on the actual source – there is no ‘one size\\nfits all’ formula.', '•  On pages 182–183 and 186–187 are some worked examples with our\\ncomments.', 'On pages 184–185 and 188–189 are sets of exam-style\\nquestions we have put together.', '‘What is the message?’\\nThe source could be a cartoon, or a poster or part of a speech –\\nsomething where the creator is trying to make a particular point.', 'Think about the following:\\n•  What is the cartoonist/speaker/artist for or against?', 'These\\nsources are not made simply to inform.', 'They might criticise,\\ndisapprove or maybe mock.', '•  How do you know?', 'What details in the source tell you the maker’s\\nview?', '•  Why then?', 'Why was the message relevant at that point in time?', '•  Note: For message questions, you do not need to comment on\\nreliability.', 'Comparison: ‘How far do Sources X and Y agree about…?’\\nLook for:\\n•  similarities and/or differences in the content of the sources\\n•  similarities and/or differences at a more subtle level, for example\\nin the attitudes shown, or the purpose.', 'For example, two text\\nsources may agree about events or details (e.g.', 'that the USSR\\ndid place missiles in Cuba) but differ in attitude (e.g.', 'one might be\\ncritical of the USSR whereas the other is supportive).', '‘How useful is Source X for…?’\\nAll sources are useful for something so think in terms of ‘How is this\\nsource useful…?’ Even a biased source is useful for telling you\\nabout the attitudes of the person or organisation who created them.', 'For example, an American poster accusing communists of crimes is\\nnot reliable evidence about communists but it is very useful in\\nshowing how far Americans were worried about communism.', 'Purpose: ‘Why was Source X published at this time?’\\nWork out the message of the source and then think about why this\\nmessage was relevant at the time or what the maker of the source\\nwanted to achieve by getting that message across.', 'For example did they want to change people’s attitudes or behaviour\\n(e.g.', 'getting them to join a movement or contribute funds to a\\nparticular cause).', '‘Are you surprised by Source X?’\\nThese questions test your knowledge and understanding of the\\nperiod in which the source was created.', 'Look for whether the events and attitudes in the source are\\nsurprising given what you know about the context of the time.', 'For example, you might be surprised to hear a speech by President\\nRichard Nixon building friendly relations with communist China in the\\n1970s although the USA was traditionally very anticommunist.', 'Or\\nyou might not be surprised because you know he was trying to end\\nthe Vietnam War and this involved improved relations with China.', '‘How reliable is Source X about…?’\\nA source is never reliable or unreliable in itself.', 'It all depends on\\nwhat you are using it for.', 'Think about the following:\\n•  The author.', 'The caption may tell you something about the author\\nor you may know something from your contextual knowledge.', 'Explain whether the author can be trusted to tell the truth about\\nparticular people, issues or events.', '•  The tone.', 'If the source uses emotive language or a biased tone\\nthis will affect how far you trust the source’s view of particular\\npeople, issues or events.', '•  Knowledge.', 'Does the source fit with or contradict your own\\nknowledge about particular people, issues or events?', '•  Cross-referencing.', 'Sometimes you will be asked to compare\\nsources, but even if you are not you can use other sources in the\\npaper to support or contradict the source and to comment on their\\nreliability.', 'Conclusion: ‘How far do Sources A–G support this statement?’\\nThis is worth most marks.', 'It builds on the previous questions and\\nasks you to use as many sources as possible in your answer.', 'Make sure you:\\n•  Address both sides of the argument: how the sources support and\\nhow they don’t support the statement.', '•  Work through source by source, explaining whether and how they\\nsupport or challenge the statement.', '•  Start a new paragraph for each source.', '•  When you make use of a source in your answer, don’t just refer to\\nit by letter.', 'Use relevant detail from the source to show how it\\nsupports or challenges the statement.', '•  Comment on the reliability of

made it expensive\\nto import foreign goods.', 'For example, in 1922 Harding introduce the\\nFordney–McCumber tariff which made imported food expensive in\\nthe USA.', 'These tariffs protected businesses against foreign\\nCOMPETITION and allowed American companies to grow even more\\nrapidly.', '3 Low taxation\\nThe Republicans kept taxation as low as possible.', 'This brought\\nsome benefits to ordinary working people, but it brought even more\\nto the very wealthy.', 'The Republican thinking was that if people kept\\ntheir own money, they would spend it on American goods

an answer.', 'Worked example based on Russia\\nDepth Study\\nNone of the answers on pages 347–350 are real student\\nanswers.', 'We have written them to help show the features of a\\ngood answer.', '(a)  Describe the problems facing the Provisional Government after\\nMarch 1917.', '[4]\\nThe war effort was failing and some soldiers were deserting.', 'The\\npeasants were demanding land and some were starting to take it.', 'The Bolsheviks had also started rioting after Lenin returned from\\nexile.', 'Workers in the cities were starving.', 'This is a very succinct response which is accurate and to\\nthe point.', 'It contains a well-developed account of the\\nproblems facing the Provisional Government.', '(b)  Explain how Lenin secured the Bolsheviks’ hold on power after\\nthe November Revolution of 1917.', '[6]\\nLenin banned non-Bolshevik papers and set up the ‘Cheka’ secret\\npolice.', 'The banks were placed under Bolshevik control.', 'These are all precise things that Lenin did, but haven’t been\\nexplained to show how they were helping the Bolsheviks\\nhold on to their power.', 'Lenin had promised free elections and these were held in late\\n1917.', 'However, under the first democratic elections to the new\\nConstituent Assembly, the Socialist Revolutionaries beat the\\nBolsheviks.', 'This could have been the end of the Bolsheviks’\\npower.', 'However, Lenin simply sent the Red Guards to close down\\nthe assembly and to put down the protests against him.', 'This is better because it is a much fuller explanation of how\\nLenin’s actions were leading to the Bolsheviks’ retention of\\npower.', 'Finally, Lenin had to negotiate a peace treaty to end the war\\nbecause he had promised the people ‘bread, peace and land’.', 'He\\nhoped that this would increase the popularity of the Bolsheviks and\\nthey would stay in power.', 'Another sound explanation, showing how Lenin was\\nattempting to secure power through popularity with the\\npeople.', '(c)  ‘The main reason that the Reds won the Civil War was\\nbecause the Whites were not unified.’ How far do you agree\\nwith this statement?', 'Explain your answer.', '[10]\\nThe success of the Reds was definitely helped by the lack of unity\\nin their opposition.', 'The Whites were made up of lots of different\\nelements such as the Czech Legion, moderate socialists and ex-\\ntsarists.', 'This meant they had different leaders and different\\nobjectives and therefore were not able to work together effectively.', 'This allowed Trotsky to defeat them one by one.', 'This is a full explanation of how the disunity of the Whites\\nled to Red success.', 'However, other things helped the Reds win the Civil War as well.', 'For example, Lenin introduced War Communism.', 'This system\\nallowed Reds total control over people’s lives and possessions in\\norder to win the war.', 'Ruthless discipline was introduced into the\\nfactories.', 'Food was taken from peasant farmers by force in order\\nto feed the Red Army and the workers in the cities.', 'Strict rationing\\nwas introduced and the Cheka was used to terrify opponents.', 'This\\npolicy ensured the Red Army was kept supplied and could\\ncontinue to fight.', 'This paragraph goes on to examine an alternative factor\\nwhich is going to help develop a much more balanced\\nresponse.', 'It explains how War Communism was also a factor\\nin the Reds’ victory.', 'I think that overall the Reds won because the Whites were not\\nunified, which helped the Reds pick them off, and also because of\\nWar Communism, which allowed the Red Army to keep fighting.', 'The answer attempts a conclusion, but this is more of a\\nsummary than a judgement.', 'What you need to do here is to\\nactively compare the factors, or to draw them together to\\nshow how they are linked.', 'For example, you might say that\\n‘although it was always going to be difficult for the Whites to\\nwin because they were such a broad alliance, it was the\\nruthless and harsh policy of War Communism, which\\ndetermined their defeat by 1920 and meant that the\\nBolsheviks held onto their power so firmly.’\\nWorked example based on Germany\\nDepth Study\\n(a)  What methods did the Nazis use to control the population?', '[4]\\nThe SS under Himmler were used to intimidate and terrorise\\npeople into obedience.', 'There was also the Gestapo who were the\\nsecret police.', 'They tapped telephones and spied on people.', 'Political opponents were taken to concentration camps.', 'Propaganda was also used to prevent opposition.', 'This was the job\\nof Goebbels who controlled what people read and heard.', 'Newspapers were taken over or their content strictly controlled.', 'Cheap radio sets were sold so people could hear Hitler’s\\nspeeches.', 'There is nothing wrong with this response but for some\\nstudents it might take too much time to write – remember to\\nbe aware of your timings for description-based questions.', 'There is plenty of accurate knowledge in this answer to give\\na full account of Nazi methods of control.', '(b)  Explain why some people opposed Nazi rule.', '[6]\\nThe Communists opposed Nazi rule because of their political\\nbeliefs.', 'This part of the answer correctly identifies a group who\\nopposed the Nazis, but it is quite vague.', 'To develop the\\nanswer, remember to add relevant examples.', 'Some youth groups such as the Edelweiss Pirates were anti-Nazi.', 'They liked to listen to music and many gangs went looking for the\\nHitler Youth to beat them up.', 'They sang songs but changed the\\nlyrics to mock Germany.', 'The second part of this answer is only describing the youth\\nopposition, rather than saying why people opposed the\\nNazis.', 'To develop the answer you would need to explain how\\nthe popularity of youth groups fell as the war progressed\\nbecause the activities were more focused on military drill\\nand the war effort.', '(c)  ‘The success of Nazi economic policy was more important than\\nthe police state in controlling opposition to the Nazis.’ How far\\ndo you agree with this statement?', 'Explain your answer.', '[10]\\nThe Nazis’ economic policies did help.', 'They promised\\nemployment and did this through the development of public works\\nsuch as building autobahns.', 'Schemes like ‘Strength Through Joy’\\ngave workers cheap theatre and cinema tickets.', 'So some workers\\nwere won over by economic improvements and popular policies\\nand this stopped opposition arising in the first place.', 'This answer starts well by addressing the question.', 'It states\\nclearly why economic policy helped to control opposition.', 'This is the clinching bit that makes all the above supporting\\ndetail into an excellent explanation.', 'From 1935 conscription was applied and rearmament meant\\nthousands of jobs in armament factories.', 'So some people were\\nscared of losing their jobs if they spoke out.', 'Germany had been hit\\nhard by the Depression and many were terrified of being out of\\nwork again.', 'This paragraph goes further by offering more evidence of\\neconomic policy stifling opposition.', 'However, the police state was also important.', 'The Nazis were very\\nsuccessful at getting rid of opposition.', 'The SS went round\\nterrorising people into obedience.', 'It could arrest people without\\ntrial and put them into concentration camps where people were\\ntortured or indoctrinated.', 'The Gestapo spied on people.', 'It had\\ninformers and encouraged people to inform on their neighbours\\nand children on their families.', 'It also tapped phones.', 'The\\nGermans thought the Gestapo was much more powerful than it\\nactually was, so lots of people informed on each other purely\\nbecause they thought the Gestapo would find out anyway.', 'There are two factors mentioned in the question.', 'This\\nparagraph shows the student has developed a more\\nbalanced answer by also examining the second factor as\\nwell.', 'In conclusion, I would say that economic successes were vital in\\ncontrolling opposition amongst ordinary citizens but that the police\\nstate was also vital for dealing with the opposition when it did\\narise; the two actually worked together.', 'The Nazis’ main political\\nopponents had been dealt with swiftly with the help of the SS and\\nGestapo, which left smaller pockets of opposition.', 'Ordinary people\\nwith weaker political motivation were more easily won over by the\\nNazis’ successes and the fear of losing their jobs.', 'This is a very good example of reaching a judgement that\\nlinks the two factors together.', 'The answer distinguishes\\nbetween two types of opposition and shows how a different\\nmethod was more successful for each.', 'Worked example based on USA Depth\\nStudy\\n(a)  What problems were faced by farmers in the USA in the\\n1920s?', '[4]\\nMany farmers did not share in the prosperity that other groups\\nexperienced in the boom.', 'Farmers had been over-producing since\\nthe end of the First World War and after the European markets\\nhad recovered from the war, they could not sell the extra produce.', 'Due to this, prices for farming produce fell rapidly in the 1920s.', 'This was made worse due to high tariffs imposed by overseas\\nnations and the competition from other countries like Canada who\\nwere able to sell their wheat at a cheaper price than the USA.', 'This is a really strong response which shows a strong\\nfactual knowledge of the problems faced by farmers.', 'However, this answer might be too long for some students to\\nwrite, so be aware of time management for description-\\nbased questions.', '(b)  Explain why Prohibition was introduced in the USA.', '[6]\\nProhibition was introduced in 1920 due to the passing of the\\nVolstead Act in 1919 which banned the sale and manufacture of\\nalcohol in the USA.', 'The first paragraph doesn’t answer the question why\\nProhibition was introduced but how it was introduced – you\\nmust be very careful here and read the question properly.', 'There was a strong temperance movement in the USA in the\\nnineteenth and early twentieth centuries such as the Anti-Saloon\\nLeague and the Women’s Christian Temperance Movement.', 'These\\ndevout Christians wanted to stop the damage that alcohol did to\\nfamily life such as causing poverty and violence.', 'This led to a lot\\nof support for Prohibition, especially in the Southern states of the\\nUSA.', 'This part of the answer is focused on the question and is a\\nvery convincing explanation of how temperance movements\\nhelped the introduction of Prohibition.', 'It is well-supported by\\nvalid evidence.', 'Also, some industrialists and doctors supported the idea of\\nProhibition.', 'Politicians also backed it as it helped them win votes\\nfrom many Christians.', 'The last part of the answer describes some other valid\\nreasons for the introduction of Prohibition, but it would be\\nbetter if it had been developed into an explanation to give a\\nfuller response.', 'These are all reasons why Prohibition was introduced.', '(c)  ‘The most successful aspect of the New Deal was the help it\\ngave to farmers.’ How far do you agree with this statement?', 'Explain your answer.', '[10]\\nThe New Deal was a massive help to farmers in the 1930s.', 'Farmers had been suffering since the 1920s and Roosevelt\\nintroduced the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) to\\nhelp solve some of the problems that they faced.', 'The first paragraph is clearly focused on the question here\\nand introduces one of the key alphabet agencies that dealt\\nwith problems faced by the agricultural sector.', 'AAA set quotas on farm production.', 'This would help push food\\nprices up as in the 1920s prices had been dropping rapidly due to\\nover-production and the impact of tariffs.', 'The AAA also helped\\nfarmers modernise their production methods which successfully\\nincreased efficiency on farms and protected the quality of the soil.', 'This was a successful aspect of the New Deal.', 'Here the point made in the first paragraph is developed into\\nan explanation and is supported by some strong evidence\\nabout its success.', 'However, other aspects of the New Deal were also successful\\nsuch as dealing with the problem of the unemployed during the\\nDepression of the 1930s.', 'The answer has now been developed to give it balance by\\nexamining another aspect of the New Deal – in this case,\\ndealing with the unemployed.', 'The Civilian Conservation Corps targeted young, unemployed men\\nfor six months at a time, often providing low-paid work in national\\nparks and forests.', 'The Public Works Administration created jobs\\nby using government money to build schools, bridges and roads.', 'Later, the Works Progress Administration united all of the job\\ncreation agencies of the New Deal to provide work for office\\nworkers, actors and artists.', 'Due to these agencies, unemployment\\nwas reduced from 25 per cent in 1933 to 14 per cent in 1937\\nproving it was successful.', 'There is a wide variety of good examples of how the New\\nDeal dealt with the unemployed – the CCC, PWA and WPA.', 'A\\nstrong explanation of the New Deal’s success is provided\\nhere by using statistical data on unemployment to support\\nthe argument.', 'Also, the New Deal dealt with the banking crisis with the\\nEmergency Banking Act.', 'This closed down all banks and only\\nallowed trustworthy ones to reopen – 5000 in total.', 'This\\nsuccessfully helped people regain confidence in the banking\\nsystem after the Crash in 1929.', 'Another valid aspect of the New Deal is explained here,\\nbanking.', 'It lacks the depth of the last paragraph, but is a\\nvalid explanation.', 'Overall, I think that the most successful aspect of the New Deal\\nwas how it helped the unemployed.', 'The conclusion is only a simple statement containing an\\nunsupported judgement.', 'This could have been improved by\\ncomparing this aspect of the New Deal against the success\\nof the others discussed in this

the Provisional Government’s collapse was their\\nunpopular policies.', 'Kerensky, the prime minister of the Provisional\\nGovernment, had launched a Summer Offensive against Germany\\nin support of

depth.', 'The role of Trotsky was significant as well.', 'He had become the\\nChairman of the Petrograd Soviet and had joined the Bolshevik\\nParty after being a more moderate Menshevik beforehand.', 'He was\\nan excellent organiser and brilliant speaker and was very\\nsignificant in helping to plan the Bolshevik seizure of power in\\nNovember 1917.', 'Another factor has been examined here – the role of Trotsky.', 'It is well-focused and provides some limited explanation but\\nlacks the depth of knowledge shown in the paragraph above.', 'Overall, I think that Lenin was really significant to the collapse of\\nthe Provisional Government but, as you can see, there were other\\nvery significant factors as well such as the unpopular policies of\\nthe Provisional Government and the actions of Trotsky.', 'The conclusion is a summary of the points above.', 'It could be\\nimproved with a clear judgement by comparing the relative\\nsignificance of the different factors.', 'Worked example: Germany 1919–45\\nHow important was the Reichstag Fire in allowing Hitler to consolidate\\npower by 1934 ?', 'Explain your answer.', 'Reichstag Fire is the factor.', 'By 1934 is the date range.', 'Allowing Hitler to consolidate power is the focus.', 'There were many events that helped Hitler become a dictator by\\n1934.', 'The Reichstag Fire in February 1933 was one of the most\\nimportant but I think that the Enabling Act in March 1933, the\\nbanning of trade unions and other political parties were also\\nimportant.', 'The most important factor was the Night of the Long\\nKnives because it gave Hitler the support of the German army, the\\nReichswehr, and removed an internal enemy for Hitler, the SA.', 'The introduction here is a great start.', 'It shows a balanced\\nargument and states a judgement about which factor is the\\nmost important and why.', 'Firstly, the Reichstag Fire of February 1933 was important for\\nHitler as it allowed him to remove the Communist Party as an\\nenemy to Nazi rule.', 'Hitler had promised the German industrialists\\nand middle classes that he would stop the threat of a communist\\nrevolution like there had been in Russia in 1917 as it threatened\\ntheir property and wealth and as the Reichstag Fire was blamed\\non a Dutch Communist, it played right into Hitler’s hands.', 'Hitler\\nused the incident to demand emergency powers from President\\nHindenburg which allowed him to use the German police and the\\nNazi SA to arrest 4000 Communists.', 'This helped Hitler increase\\nhis hold over Germany by getting rid of one of the Nazi’s main\\nenemies, securing the support of German elites as well as close\\ndown opposition newspapers, meetings and imprison suspects\\nand hold them without trial.', 'This paragraph is well-focused on the event addressed in\\nthe question.', 'It shows how the Reichstag Fire allowed Hitler\\nto increase his power by removing the Communists and\\nremoving other opponents of the Nazis.', 'There is some\\nstrong factual knowledge to support the explanations\\nmaking this a well-developed point.', 'However, also important was the Enabling Act which became law\\nin March 1933.', 'Hitler managed to get the support of the\\nNationalists and the Centre Party in the Reichstag to pass the law.', 'This was made easier because the Communist Party had been\\nbanned from the Reichstag and the SA and SS were used to\\nintimidate members of the Reichstag during the vote.', 'The Enabling\\nAct gave Hitler the power to make laws without consulting the\\nReichstag or the president, which made him a virtual dictator.', 'He\\nwas then able to use this new power to ban other political parties\\nin Germany and close down all of the trade unions, thus\\nincreasing his power even more.', 'Here we can see balance provided to the argument by\\nexamining other relevant events that increased Hitler’s\\npower.', 'Once again, the explanations are supported by good\\nknowledge and understanding.', 'I think the most important event was the Night of the Long Knives\\nin June 1934.', 'This was when Hitler used the SS, led by Himmler,\\nto eliminate members of the SA, including their leader Rohm.', 'Rohm was demanding a second revolution and wanted the SA to\\nbecome the new official German army, replacing the Reichswehr.', 'By arresting and murdering members of the SA, Hitler increased\\nhis support from the President and the official army who then\\nagreed to take an oath of loyalty in August 1934.', 'This eliminated\\nthe last groups that threatened a Nazi dictatorship which is why it\\nwas a more important factor than the others because up until this\\npoint, Hitler could still be removed by the president, the SA or the\\nGerman army.', 'There is an attempt here to make a judgement by explaining\\nthe most important factor – in this case, the Night of the\\nLong Knives.', 'The argument and explanations are very\\nconvincing and well-supported as it compares the relative\\nimportance of this factor against the other factors from the\\nrest of the answer.', 'However, this may have benefited from a\\nseparate conclusion to fully develop this judgement.', 'Worked example: USA 1919–41\\nHow important was mass production as a cause of the economic boom in\\nthe 1920s ?', 'Explain your answer.', 'Mass production is the factor.', 'The 1920s is the date range.', 'A cause of the economic boom is the focus.', 'There were many causes of the boom in the USA in the 1920s\\nsuch as mass production, advertising, Republican policies and the\\nUSA’s natural resources.', 'This led to wealth and prosperity for\\nmany until 1929 when the Wall Street Crash brought it all to an\\nend, leading to the Depression.', 'The introduction here is a list of factors that led to the\\neconomic boom.', 'It is then followed by material that is not\\nreally relevant – it would have benefited from a developed\\nargument about the most important factor.', 'Mass production is where companies used new inventions and\\nmachines to produce consumer goods in large amounts.', 'This was\\nhelped by the fact that electricity was now used to power many\\nfactories.', 'Henry Ford used the principles of mass production in his\\nnew assembly line system where each worker had a specific job to\\ndo before it passed on to the next worker.', 'The most famous car\\nproduced was the Model T. By 1925, over 15 million of these cars\\nwere produced using mass production.', 'The production of the car\\nled to other industries growing such as steel, rubber and glass – in\\nfact, the car industry used 75 per cent of all the glass produced in\\nthe USA.', 'The first paragraph is well-focused on mass production and\\nprovides some well-selected examples and detailed\\ndescription.', 'It does make a good link at the end of the\\nparagraph between the car industry and other related\\nindustries like glass and rubber, but the explanation\\nprovided is limited.', 'Advertising was also important to the boom.', 'New goods like\\nfridges, radios and cars were advertised on billboards, in\\nmagazines, newspapers and even at the cinema.', 'Mail-order\\ncompanies were set up which helped people in the countryside to\\naccess these new goods.', 'Many people borrowed money or used\\nhire-purchase to buy these goods so they could pay for them in\\ninstalments.', 'This meant that companies were making huge profits\\nwhich pushed up share prices in many industries.', 'Here the answer provides some balance.', 'Advertising is\\nexamined as a cause and relevant examples of this are\\nstated convincingly.', 'Some explanation of its importance is\\ngiven to help develop the answer.', 'Republican policies like laissez-faire helped the economy a lot.', 'Low taxes and tariffs were used to encourage Americans to buy\\nmore from American companies.', 'This small paragraph briefly describes Republican policies –\\nit is clear that these policies are understood, but there is\\nonly a very limited explanation of their importance as a\\ncause of the boom.', 'Also, the USA’s natural resources fuelled the boom.', 'America had\\nlots of minerals such as iron, coal, gas and oil.', 'American\\ncompanies didn’t have to import these things so they could grow\\nmuch quicker and more cheaply than other countries.', 'Similar to the previous paragraph, this explanation of the\\nUSA’s natural resources is brief and under-developed.', 'The\\nuse of more examples would add greater detail.', 'In conclusion, I think that the most important cause of the\\neconomic boom in the 1920s was mass production.', 'It made new\\nproducts cheaper so more people could buy them.', 'This gave\\nbusinesses higher profits so they could build new factories.', 'It also\\nencouraged people to invest in these companies by buying shares\\nand when the share prices went up people were even richer – this\\nis known as confidence.', 'The conclusion attempts to make a judgement about the\\nmost important cause.', 'It is a crucial paragraph as it explains\\nthe material used in the earlier paragraph on mass\\nproduction, which helps provide a much more balanced\\nexplanation overall.', 'It could be improved by comparing the\\nimportance of mass production against the other factors.', 'Glossary\\nAbyssinian crisis International tensions resulting from invasion

Many historians argue that the treaty's emphasis on punishing Germany for its role in the war, rather than focusing on a fair and lasting peace, ultimately doomed the treaty to failure.\n",
