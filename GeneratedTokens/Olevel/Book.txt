britain particularly interested oilfields iraq already large involvement oil industry neighbouring iran

simple answer 
originally turkish government intended accept treaty even though almost turks outraged terms

nationalists unable restore turkish empires territories drove greeks smyrna forced french negotiate withdrawing turkish territory

however historians agree far failures fault league far factors beyond leagues control important 
biggest factors economic depression 1930s lets start 
figure 1 challenges faced league 1930s 
economic depression late 1920s international trade prospered 
usa worlds richest nation market countries export 
also helped economic recovery loans many countries particularly germany 
1929 disaster struck 
wall street crash usa started long depression quickly caused economic problems throughout rest world see figure 2 
1930s result depression much goodw ill late 1920s evaporated 
us loans dried bu sinesses many countries went bankrupt leading unemployment 
countries tried protect industries putting tariffs imports 
meant trading partners thing trade got even worse 
many countries including germany japan italy britain started rearm build armed forces way trying get industries working giving jobs unemployed 
new armies caused alarm tension 
internationalist spirit 1920s replaced nationalist beggar neighbour approach 1930s 
revision tip key idea grasp figure 2 depression created economic problems led political problems later 
two important examples germany japan make sure describe depression affected 
figure 2 usa one way league nations could stop one country invading another use economic sanctions 
depression made usa unwilling help economic sanctions would make economy even worse 
japan depression threatened bankrupt japan 
main export silk usa usa buying less silk 
japan less money buy food raw materials

started invading manchuria part china 1931

viet cong tactics troops early 1965 viet cong 170000 soldiers 
heavily outnumbered outgunned 
match us south vietnamese forces open warfare 
november 1965 la dreng valley us forces killed 2000 viet cong loss 300 troops 
however daunt ho chi minh 
guerilla warfare ho used guerrilla warfare 
guerrilla spanish word literally means little war 
guerrilla warfare meant avoiding big battles using hitandrun raids 
guerrillas wear uniform 
hard tell apart peasants villages

worked small groups 
attacked disappeared jungle villages tunnels see figure 31 
guerrilla attacks aimed wear enemy soldiers wreck morale 
us soldiers lived constant fear ambushes booby traps pits filled sharpened bamboo stakes 11 per cent us casualties caused booby traps 
another 51 per cent ambushes handtohand combat 
viet cong favoured closequarter fighting knew americans would use air power fear hitting troops 
civilians ho knew important keep population side 
viet cong fighters courteous respectful vietnamese peasants 
helped fields busy periods 
however quite prepared kill peasants opposed cooperated enemies 
also conducted campaign terror police tax collectors teachers employees south vietnamese government 
1966 1971 viet cong killed estimated 27000 civilians 
supplies viet cong depended supplies north vietnam came along ho chi minh trail 
us south vietnamese planes bombed constantly 40000 vietnamese worked keep open whatever cost 
commitment total viet cong north vietnamese dead war estimated 1 million far higher us losses 
however price ho chi minh prepared pay 
whatever casualties replacement troops available

soldiers send back reports body counts 
searchanddestroy missions kill viet cong soldiers problems 
raids often based inadequate information 
inexperienced us troops often walked traps 
innocent villages mistaken viet cong strongholds

americans used 82 million litres agent orange spray thousands square kilometres jungle 
napalm another widely used chemical weapon 
destroyed jungles guerrillas might hide 
also burned skin bone 
many civilians soldiers also killed harmed chemical weapons 
conscription morale early stages war us troops professional soldiers 
morale good performed well 
however war intensified us needed soldiers introduced draft conscription 
soon young men left school college could called us army 
1967 many soldiers young men never army 
average age us troops 19 
conscripts knew little vietnam cared little democracy communism 
wanted get home alive 
contrast viet cong fighting country cause many believed 
morale among us conscripts often low 
tackle problem generals introduced policy giving troops oneyear term service 
backfired soon soldiers gained experience sent home

common error give view without considering another giving little explanation 
many arguments support view treaty versailles fair settlement 
begin strongly believed germany started war therefore responsible 
certainly true germany invaded neutral belgium 1914 broke international treaties 
another argument fighting western front took place belgium france 
france lost around 16 million troops civilians well suffering huge damage industry towns agriculture 
fighting german soil strong case germany pay compensation 
first three paragraphs give reasons historians people time would argue treaty fair 
could put single paragraph help organise thinking put point per paragraph 
third argument treaty harsh critics claimed 
germany certainly lost territory versailles settlement 10 per cent land colonies 125 per cent population 
however could lot harsher 
clemenceau wanted germany broken small states 
look treaty brestlitovsk germany forced russia sign 1918 see germany much harsher terms russia allies germany versailles 
course terms seen unfair 
germans regarded treaty diktat consulted 
also believed allies operated double standards 
example german army limited 100000 men france britain countries reduce armed forces levels 
another term could seen unfair fact many germans left outside germany result treaty 
paragraph gives reasons historians people time might argue treaty unfair 
overall agree statement

response truman doctrine designed stop spread communism 
good clear opening 
quite interesting point really answering question

soviets saw dollar imperialism trying create empire states dependent us dollars 
clear point made followed well supporting evidence 
hand could argued ussr responsible cold war 
end second world war soviet troops drove german forces eastern europe 
however germany surrendered 1945 soviet forces stayed eastern european states 
time stalin encouraged supported communist supporters within states like poland hungary czechoslovakia take control countries set communist governments supported ussr 
caused great deal tension usa britain saw ussr building empire planning take rest europe well 
still strong balancing point although quite crystal clear two paragraphs

powerful people must beware 
sometimes asked whether possible slow industrialisation bit 
comrades possible slacken would mean falling behind 
fall behind get beaten lenin said october revolution either perish overtake outstrip advanced capitalist countries 50 100 years behind advanced countries 
either make good difference ten years crush us 
stalin speaking 1931

look different reasons stalin wanting modernise ussr 
think would placed top priority 
stalin want modernise soviet industry 
stalin want modernise soviet agriculture 
security might seem clear source 5 stalin wanted give ussr modern industrial economy 
security certainly key factor 
first world war shown country could fight modern war industries produce weapons equipment needed impossible equip army rifles uniforms without factories make 
factories needed iron steel textiles resources turn rifles uniforms 
without coal electricity power would factories anyway 
also worth noting stalin planned many new industrial projects east ussr potentially safer invasion 
socialism one country closely connected policy socialism one country 
policy lot support communist party ussr generally 
stalin saw opportunity harness nationalist pride develop economy 
stalin took power much russias industrial equipment imported 
stalin wanted make ussr selfsufficient could make everything needed 
wanted ussr compete equal terms economies west 
hoped see time west would importing goods ussr way around 
also wanted improve standards living russia better housing mass education health care people would value communist rule 
power control reason 
already seen stalin cunning political operator made alliances different groups order dispose rivals 
1928 allied bukharin supporters believed nep 
order undermine bukharin switched position became supporter greater state planning control construction large projects like railways hydroelectric dams 
removed bukharin opponents industrialisation programme also became powerful means controlling country 
many political prisoners sent work appalling conditions labour camps building projects like white sea baltic canal 
fate prisoners often discouraged others 
similarly anyone complained criticised stalins programme could accused undermining countrys progress 
ideology stalin also ideological reasons 
communist theory said people workers communism work 
1928 one five russians industrial workers 
stalin trying build power base industrial workers hoped would benefit industrialisation support

stalin want modernise soviet agriculture 
feeding workers enormous changes fiveyear plans successful stalin needed modernise ussrs agriculture well 
agriculture biggest single resource ussr 
vast majority russians worked agriculture wanted make fullest use resource 
stalins industrialisation programme created huge army workers many living newly built towns working industry producing food 
needed fed yet early 1928 country already 2 million tons short grain needed feed workers 
ussr actually importing food 
bad economic point view 
also humiliating political view country huge agricultural resources could feed people 
food exports stalin also wanted try raise money industrialisation programme selling exports surplus food abroad 
could could fully exploit ussrs agricultural resources massively increase food production 
could could develop industry improve living standards workers 
building reputation stalin probably thought modernising agriculture would also enhance reputation way fiveyear plans industry would 
full propaganda machine ussr mobilised 
praised modernisation agriculture celebrated arrival new techniques machinery especially tractors 
also relentlessly attacked opposed 
ending nep nep proved popular peasants especially prosperous peasants known kulaks 
kulaks usually owned better land average peasant meant could grow food sell surplus food profit 
small merchants also benefited nep 
bought surplus food peasants kulaks sold towns cities profit 
merchants often called nepmen 
stalin built lot support within communist party ideas socialism one country 
also undermined bukharin opposing nep 
unacceptable stalin countryside operating old nep

stalins method collectivisation forcing farmers combine lands cattle farm together collectively see factfile 
peasants still working small plots land using ageold methods 
making peasants work larger farms meant would easier make efficient use tractors fertilisers modern methods farming 
would produce food 
mechanised farming would require fewer workers release large numbers peasants work growing industries 
would easier collect grain taxes larger farms 
would also socialist way farming farmers would co operate rather selling food f profit 
factfile collectivisation peasants put lands together form large joint farms kolkhoz could keep small plots personal use 
animals tools shared 
motor tractors provided government 
ninety per cent produce would sold state profits shared 
remaining 10 per cent produce feed kolkhoz 
resistance one big problem collectivisation 
peasants want hand ove r animals tools ordered around farm managers 
wanted farm piece land without interference government

simple answer depression 
many important factors allowed nazis seize oppor tunity 
factor 1 nazi campaigning nazi campaign methods modern effective 
nazis greatest campaigning asset hitler 
pow erful speaker 
hitler ran president 1932 
despite defeat campaign raised profile hugely 
years ahead time communicator

source 10 english translation 1931 nazi election poster 
nazis relied generalised slogan uniting people going back traditional values bu never clear meant terms policies 
made hard criticise 
criticised specific policy quite likely drop 
example industrialists expressed concern nazi plans nationalise industry simply droppe policy 
nazis repeated every oppor tunity believed jews communists weimar politicians treaty versailles causes germanys problems 
expressed contempt weimars democratic system said unable solve germanys economic problems

nazis proclaim build promise provide work freedom bread 
accuse opposing parties planning use terror corruption lies strategies basis government 
backed campaigns practical action

revision tip note two examples increasing nazi support ready explain 
factor 2 negative cohesion cohesion means bringing together 
historian gordon craig believed nazis benefited negative cohesion 
people supported nazis shared nazi views would positive cohesion shared nazi fears hate hate ill support factor 3 disillusionment democracy perhaps biggest negative dissatisfaction democracy weimar germany 
politicians seemed unable tackle problems depression 
depression began bite chancellor brüning actually cut government spending welfare benefits 
urged germans make sacrifices 
brüning called new elections 1930 
disastrous decision gave nazis oppor tunity exploit discontent germany 
unemployment heading towards 6 million average germans income fallen 40 pe r cent since 1929

factor 4 communist threat crisis deepened communist support rising 
nazis turned advantage 
fear communism another shared negative 
frequent street battles communist gangs police 
large unruly groups unemployed workers gathered street corners 
contrast sa ss gave impression discipline order 
many people felt country needed kind order see source 12 
business leaders feared communists plans introduce state control businesses 
also concerned growing strength germanys trade unions 
felt nazis would combat threats began put money nazi campaign funds 
think 
1 sentence explain negative cohesion someone never heard phrase 
2 think gordon craig right people supported nazis negative reasons rather positive reasons 
farmers also alarmed communists 
ussr communist government taken land 
millions peasants killed imprisoned process 
contrast nazis promised help germanys desperately struggling small farmers 
factor 5 decadence modern decadent weimar culture nazis could count felt traditional german values threat 
nazis talked restoring oldfashioned values 
factor 6 weak opposition social democratic party made grave mistake thinking german people would fall vague promises accusations 
also failed work parties particularly communists 
eberts crushing communists 191920 l eft bitter memories nazis exploited divisions among oppon ents 
result nazi support rocketed 
example neidenburg east prussia nazi support rose 23 pe r cent 1928 ove r 25 pe r cent 1931 e ven though town local nazi party hitler never went 
know work ws

social opposition social oppos ition means people groups tried keep identity refused accept conform nazi ideals 
much common political oppos ition 
historians identified many examples particularly novelty nazis worn nature rule clearer ordinary germans 
widespread apathy towards parades propaganda particularly 1936 
example local party officials reported increasingly bully people attend nazi rallies nazis use radio wardens force people listen hitlers speeches 
gestapo reported lot complaining bars trains public places 
reported people refused give heil hitler salute others told jokes hitler nazis refused contribute party funds 
national church leaders publicly criticised nazis
